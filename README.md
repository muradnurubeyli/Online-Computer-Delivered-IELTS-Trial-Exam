# Trial Exam:
IELTS Online Trial Exam - Web application.

In this folder, you can find some codes which I and my teacher wrote while developing ieltstrial.com.
This Web Application developed for those who are planning to take official IELTS exams.The project developed for Roof Academic Training - ISO 9001-2015 certified education company specialized in language and international exam preparation. Online IELTS trial exams are held regularly by the center in partnership with British Council Azerbaijan. These tests are prepared by specifically certified teachers.

IELTS and SAT Trial are among the world's first online web exam applications.

Currently, updates are ongoing for both apps.

# General structure of exam application:
Generally, the exam is the same as the official computer-delivered / paper based exam like IELTS.
Trial exams are held every week. Questions are prepared by British Council Azerbaijan with the help of specifically certified teachers. Students who want to test their skills before taking the official exam, firstly signing up for the website, answering few survey questions about themselves, and then registering for the available exams. After the exam finished, students again answer few questions about their experience.

# Exam rules:
- Listening section starts first. Moving on between parts disabled. The section lasts 35-40 minutes and has 40 questions. The application will move to the next part automatically when the audio finishes. 
- Reading section starts automatically after the listening section ends. Moving on between passages enabled. The section lasts 1 hour and has 40 questions.
- Writing section starts automatically after the reading section ends. Moving on between tasks enabled. The section lasts 1 hour and has 2 passages.

# Application rules:
- Exams regularly start at 10 AM and being active for the next 3 hours.
- Registrations for the exams are disabling automatically 12 hours before the exams' start time.
- When an authorized person starts the exam from the control panel, the session for the exam starts. The session's clean time is 3 hours. It means that after the session starts, students will only have 3 hours to solve exam questions. For example: Let's assume that students didn't join the exam when it started. Then students will lose some of their time depending on the time when they joined the exam. 
More examples: The exam will start at 10 AM. John forgot to wake up and joined the exam at 12:00. He will start from listening and will move on. But because he joined the exam 2 hours late, he will not have the full time to finish the reading and writing section: Listening 35-40 minutes, Reading 1 hour. Total of 1 hour 35-40 minutes. The exam was started at 10 AM and the session's clean time was 3 hours. This means that session will close itself at 13:00. Because John has joined the exam at 12:00, he will only able to finish the listening section. He will only have 20 or 25 minutes to look at reading questions. This works like this for every section.
- Students who enrolled for the exam, must open the exam page only in one browser. If the same exam from the same account is opened in two different browsers, then the listening section and other sections will not work properly. We developed this feature to avoid possible cheatings.
- For the best experience, we recommend to you use a computer while doing the listening section.

# How application works:
Students who enrolled for the exam cannot start the exam until exam time starts. Firstly, students who register for the available exam are choosing their speaking times from the website. Once one speaking time is chosen, it disappears from the list and other students must choose other available times. But the same available times can be chosen by different students if teachers of the related times are different (Students don't see teachers. Only authorized people can see teachers from the control panel). After that students can start to exam. Also authorized people who check the control panel decide which students can participate in the exam. Exams are free for the Roof Academic Training students and paid for students who enroll outside the course. After reading instructions for every section, when students press the "Start the section" button remaining section starts, and the time given for the section begins. If some student disconnects from the exam or accidentally closes the exam tab then he or she can come back and continue where he/she left off. But because he or she pressed the "Start" button, the time will continue to decline, regardless of which time interval he or she was missing. That's why students must try not to leave the exam after pressing the "Start" button. The exam starts with the Listening section. The listening section generally lasts between 35-40 minutes. Each part lasts as much as its audio's length. If a student leaves the exam after pressing the "Start the listening section" button during the listening section, when he or she comes back they will join the exam where were their time left off. Which means they can miss some audios or even parts. Also, students can't access the audios. Because we disabled the right click and "view inspect, view page source" in the listening section. Every beginning of the part application gives 30 seconds for students to look at the questions. Then audio starts. After the end of the audio's first 2.5 minutes, again application gives 30 seconds for students to look at the rest of the questions that remain in the active part. After each part ends, the application gives 2 minutes for students to check their all answers in the following part. This structure happening in every part except part 4. Part 4 has no gap between beginning and end (like in the real exam). After the listening section ends reading starts. In the reading section, students will have 1 hour to answer 40 questions. After reading ends writing starts. Writing also lasts 1 hour and students can move between two sections whenever they want. To avoid the cheating in writing section, we disabled copy-paste (right click and ctrl+c and ctr+v) shortcuts. We did this because some students may try to copy or past the answers, they found on the internet. 

# Future updates:
In the future, we will bring categorized exams with some special offers. Along with that, we are planning to bring an online support system, sample exam section to the homepage, students' profile section with their past exam results, online payment function and etc
