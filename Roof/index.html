                            <p>The general assumption is that older workers are paid more in spite of, rather than
                                because of, their productivity. That might partly explain why, when employers are under
                                pressure to cut costs, they persuade a 55-year old to take early retirement. Take away
                                seniority-based pay scales, and older workers may become a much more attractive
                                employment proposition. But most employers and many workers are uncomfortable with the
                                idea of reducing someone’s pay in later life – although manual workers on piece-rates
                                often earn less as they get older. So retaining the services of older workers may mean
                                employing them in different ways.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                One innovation was devised by IBM Belgium. Faced with the need to cut staff costs, and
                                having decided to concentrate cuts on 55 to 60-year olds, IBM set up a separate company
                                called Skill Team, which re-employed any of the early retired who wanted to go on
                                working up to the age of 60. An employee who joined Skill Team at the age of 55 on a
                                five-year contract would work for 58% of his time, over the full period, for 88% of his
                                last IBM salary. The company offered services to IBM, thus allowing it to retain access
                                to some of the intellectual capital it would otherwise have lost.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The best way to tempt the old to go on working may be to build on such ‘bridge’ jobs:
                                part-time or temporary employment that creates a more gradual transition from full-time
                                work to retirement. Studies have found that, in the United States, nearly half of all
                                men and women who had been in full-time jobs in middle age moved into such ‘bridge’ jobs
                                at the end of their working lives. In general, it is the best-paid and worst-paid who
                                carry on working. There seem to be two very different types of bridge job-holder – those
                                who continue working because they have to and those who continue working because they
                                want to, even though they could afford to retire.
                            </p>

                            <p>If the job market grows more flexible, the old may find more jobs that suit them. Often,
                                they will be self-employed. Sometimes, they may start their own businesses: a study by
                                David Storey of Warwick University found that in Britain 70% of businesses started by
                                people over 55 survived, compared with an overall national average of only 19%. But
                                whatever pattern of employment they choose, in the coming years the skills of these
                                ‘grey workers’ will have to be increasingly acknowledged and rewarded.
                            </p>

                            <p>Clearly, when older people do heavy physical work, their age may affect their
                                productivity.
                                But other skills may increase with age, including many that are crucial for good
                                management,
                                such as an ability to handle people diplomatically, to run a meeting or to spot a
                                problem
                                before it blows up. Peter Hicks, who co-ordinates OECD* work on the policy implications
                                of
                                ageing, says that plenty of research suggests older people are paid more because they
                                are
                                worth more.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                And the virtues of the young may be exaggerated. ‘The few companies that have kept on
                                older
                                workers find they have good judgement and their productivity is good,’ says Peter
                                Peterson,
                                author of a recent book on the impact of ageing. ‘Besides, their education standards are
                                much better than those of today’s young high-school graduates.’ Companies may say that
                                older
                                workers are not worth training because they are reaching the end of their working lives;
                                in
                                fact, young people tend to switch jobs so frequently that they offer the worst returns
                                on
                                training. The median age for employer-driven training is the late 40s and early 50s, and
                                this training goes mainly to managers.

                                Marie Curie is probably the most famous woman scientist who has ever lived. Born Maria
                                Sklodowska in Poland in 1867, she is famous for her work on radioactivity, and was twice
                                a
                                winner of the Nobel Prize. With her husband, Pierre Curie, and Henri Becquerel, she was
                                awarded the 1903 Nobel Prize for Physics, and was then sole winner of the 1911 Nobel
                                Prize
                                for Chemistry. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                From childhood, Marie was remarkable for her prodigious memory, and at the age of 16 won
                                a
                                gold medal on completion of her secondary education. Because her father lost his savings
                                through bad investment, she then had to take work as a teacher. From her earnings she
                                was
                                able to finance her sister Bronia’s medical studies in Paris, on the understanding that
                                Bronia would, in turn, later help her to get an education.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In 1891 this promise was fulfilled and Marie went to Paris and began to study at the
                                Sorbonne (the University of Paris). She often worked far into the night and lived on
                                little
                                more than bread and butter and tea. She came first in the examination in the physical
                                sciences in 1893, and in 1894 was placed second in the examination in mathematical
                                sciences.
                                It was not until the spring of that year that she was introduced to Pierre Curie.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The marriage of Pierre and Marie Curie in 1895 marked the start of a partnership that
                                was
                                soon to achieve results of world significance. Following Henri Becquerel’s discovery in
                                1896
                                of a new phenomenon, which Marie later called ‘radioactivity’, Marie Curie decided to

                                out if the radioactivity discovered in uranium was to be found in other elements. She
                                discovered that this was true for thorium.

                                Turning her attention to minerals, she found her interest drawn to pitchblende, a
                                mineral
                                whose radioactivity, superior to that of pure uranium, could be explained only by the
                                presence in the ore of small quantities of an unknown substance of very high activity.
                                Pierre Curie joined her in the work that she had undertaken to resolve this problem, and
                                that led to the discovery of the new elements, polonium and radium. While Pierre Curie
                                devoted himself chiefly to the physical study of the new radiations, Marie Curie
                                struggled
                                to obtain pure radium in the metallic state. This was achieved with the help of the
                                chemist
                                André-Louis Debierne, one of Pierre Curie’s pupils. Based on the results of this
                                research,
                                Marie Curie received her Doctorate of Science, and in 1903 Marie and Pierre shared with
                                Becquerel the Nobel Prize for Physics for the discovery of radioactivity.

                                The births of Marie’s two daughters, Irène and Eve, in 1897 and 1904 failed to interrupt
                                her
                                scientific work. She was appointed lecturer in physics at the École Normale Supérieure
                                for
                                girls in Sèvres, France (1900), and introduced a method of teaching based on
                                experimental
                                demonstrations. In December 1904 she was appointed chief assistant in the laboratory
                                directed by Pierre Curie.

                                The sudden death of her husband in 1906 was a bitter blow to Marie Curie, but was also a
                                turning point in her career: henceforth she was to devote all her energy to completing
                                alone
                                the scientific work that they had undertaken. On May 13, 1906, she was appointed to the
                                professorship that had been left vacant on her husband’s death, becoming the first woman
                                to
                                teach at the Sorbonne. In 1911 she was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for the
                                isolation of a pure form of radium.

                                During World War I, Marie Curie, with the help of her daughter Irène, devoted herself to
                                the
                                development of the use of X-radiography, including the mobile units which came to be
                                known
                                as ‘Little Curies’, used for the treatment of wounded soldiers. In 1918 the Radium
                                Institute, whose staff Irène had joined, began to operate in earnest, and became a
                                centre
                                for nuclear physics and chemistry. Marie Curie, now at the highest point of her fame
                                and,
                                from 1922, a member of the Academy of Medicine, researched the chemistry of radioactive
                                substances and their medical applications.

                                In 1921, accompanied by her two daughters, Marie Curie made a triumphant journey to the
                                United States to raise funds for research on radium. Women there presented her with a
                                gram
                                of radium for her campaign. Marie also gave lectures in Belgium, Brazil, Spain and
                                Czechoslovakia and, in addition, had the satisfaction of seeing the development of the
                                Curie
                                Foundation in Paris, and the inauguration in 1932 in Warsaw of the Radium Institute,
                                where
                                her sister Bronia became director.

                                One of Marie Curie’s outstanding achievements was to have understood the need to
                                accumulate
                                intense radioactive sources, not only to treat illness but also to maintain an abundant
                                supply for research. The existence in Paris at the Radium Institute of a stock of 1.5
                                grams
                                of radium made a decisive contribution to the success of the experiments undertaken in
                                the
                                years around 1930. This work prepared the way for the discovery of the neutron by Sir
                                James
                                Chadwick and, above all, for the discovery in 1934 by Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie of
                                artificial radioactivity. A few months after this discovery, Marie Curie died as a
                                result of
                                leukaemia caused by exposure to radiation. She had often carried test tubes containing
                                radioactive isotopes in her pocket, remarking on the pretty blue-green light they gave
                                off.

                                Her contribution to physics had been immense, not only in her own work, the importance
                                of
                                which had been demonstrated by her two Nobel Prizes, but because of her influence on
                                subsequent generations of nuclear physicists and chemists.
