                                        Some years ago, when several theoretical physicists, principally Dirk Helbing
                                        and
                                        Boris
                                        Kerner of Stuttgart, Germany, began publishing papers on traffic flow in
                                        publications
                                        normally read by traffic engineers, they were clearly working outside their
                                        usual
                                        sphere of
                                        investigation. They had noticed that if they simulated the movement of vehicles
                                        on a
                                        highway, using the equations that describe how the molecules of a gas move, some
                                        very
                                        strange results emerged. Of course, vehicles do not behave exactly like gas
                                        molecules: for
                                        example, drivers try to avoid collisions by slowing down when they get too near
                                        another
                                        vehicle, whereas gas molecules have no such concern. However, the physicists
                                        modified the
                                        equations to take the differences into account and the overall description of
                                        traffic as a
                                        flowing gas has proved to be a very good one; the moving-gas model of traffic
                                        reproduces
                                        many phenomena seen in real-world traffic.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The strangest thing that came out of these equations, however, was the
                                        implication
                                        that
                                        congestion can arise completely spontaneously; no external causes are necessary.
                                        Vehicles
                                        can be flowing freely along, at a density still well below what the road can
                                        handle,
                                        and
                                        then suddenly gel into a slow-moving ooze. Under the right conditions a brief
                                        and
                                        local
                                        fluctuation in the speed or the distance between vehicles is all it takes to
                                        trigger
                                        a
                                        system-wide breakdown that persists for hours. In fact, the physicists’ analysis
                                        suggested
                                        such spontaneous breakdowns in traffic flow probably occur quite frequently on
                                        highways.

                                    <h6>Dramatic effects can result from small changes in traffic just as in nature</h6>
                                    <p>
                                        Though a decidedly unsettling discovery, this showed striking similarities to
                                        the
                                        phenomena
                                        popularized as ‘chaos theory’. This theory has arisen from the understanding
                                        that in
                                        any
                                        complex interacting system which is made of many parts, each part affects the
                                        others.
                                        Consequently, tiny variations in one part of a complex system can grow in huge
                                        but
                                        unpredictable ways. This type of dramatic change from one state to another is
                                        similar to
                                        what happens when a chemical substance changes from a vapor to a liquid. It
                                        often
                                        happens
                                        that water in a cloud remains as a gas even after its temperature and density
                                        have
                                        reached
                                        the point where it could condense into water droplets. However, if the vapor
                                        encounters a
                                        solid surface, even something as small as a speck of dust, condensation can take
                                        place and
                                        the transition from vapor to liquid finally occurs. Helbing and Kerner see
                                        traffic
                                        as a
                                        complex interacting system. They found that a small fluctuation in traffic
                                        density
                                        can act
                                        as the ‘speck of dust’ causing a sudden change from freely moving traffic to
                                        synchronized
                                        traffic, when vehicles in all lanes abruptly slow down and start moving at the
                                        same
                                        speed,
                                        making passing impossible.

                                        Kerner of Stuttgart, Germany, began publishing papers on traffic flow in
                                        publications
                                        normally read by traffic engineers, they were clearly working outside their

                                        sphere of
                                        investigation. They had noticed that if they simulated the movement of vehicles
                                        on a
                                        highway, using the equations that describe how the molecules of a gas move, some
                                        very
                                        strange results emerged. Of course, vehicles do not behave exactly like gas
                                        molecules: for
                                        example, drivers try to avoid collisions by slowing down when they get too near
                                        another
                                        vehicle, whereas gas molecules have no such concern. However, the physicists
                                        modified the
                                        equations to take the differences into account and the overall description of
                                        traffic as a
                                        flowing gas has proved to be a very good one; the moving-gas model of traffic
                                        reproduces
                                        many phenomena seen in real-world traffic.

                                        The strangest thing that came out of these equations, however, was the
                                        implication
                                        that
                                        congestion can arise completely spontaneously; no external causes are necessary.

                                        can be flowing freely along, at a density still well below what the road can
                                        handle,
                                        and
                                        then suddenly gel into a slow-moving ooze. Under the right conditions a brief

                                        fluctuation in the speed or the distance between vehicles is all it takes to
                                        trigger
                                        a
                                        system-wide breakdown that persists for hours. In fact, the physicists’ analysis
                                        suggested
                                        such spontaneous breakdowns in traffic flow probably occur quite frequently on
                                        highways.

                                        Though a decidedly unsettling discovery, this showed striking similarities to
                                        the
                                        phenomena
                                        popularized as ‘chaos theory’. This theory has arisen from the understanding
                                        that in
                                        any
                                        complex interacting system which is made of many parts, each part affects the
                                        others.
                                        Consequently, tiny variations in one part of a complex system can grow in huge
                                        but
                                        unpredictable ways. This type of dramatic change from one state to another is
                                        similar to
                                        what happens when a chemical substance changes from a vapor to a liquid. It
                                        often
                                        happens
                                        that water in a cloud remains as a gas even after its temperature and density
                                        have
                                        reached
                                        the point where it could condense into water droplets. However, if the vapor
                                        encounters a
                                        solid surface, even something as small as a speck of dust, condensation can take
                                        place and
                                        the transition from vapor to liquid finally occurs. Helbing and Kerner see
                                        traffic

                                        complex interacting system. They found that a small fluctuation in traffic

                                        can act
                                        as the ‘speck of dust’ causing a sudden change from freely moving traffic to

                                        traffic, when vehicles in all lanes abruptly slow down and start moving at the

                                        making passing impossible.

                                        normally read by traffic engineers, they were clearly working outside their
                                        usual
                                        sphere of
                                        investigation. They had noticed that if they simulated the movement of vehicles
                                        on a
                                        highway, using the equations that describe how the molecules of a gas move, some
                                        very
                                        strange results emerged. Of course, vehicles do not behave exactly like gas
                                        molecules: for
                                        example, drivers try to avoid collisions by slowing down when they get too near
                                        another
                                        vehicle, whereas gas molecules have no such concern. However, the physicists
                                        modified the
                                        equations to take the differences into account and the overall description of
                                        traffic as a
                                        flowing gas has proved to be a very good one; the moving-gas model of traffic
                                        reproduces
                                        many phenomena seen in real-world traffic.

                                        The strangest thing that came out of these equations, however, was the
                                        implication
                                        that
                                        congestion can arise completely spontaneously; no external causes are necessary.
                                        Vehicles
                                        can be flowing freely along, at a density still well below what the road can
                                        handle,
                                        and
                                        then suddenly gel into a slow-moving ooze. Under the right conditions a brief
                                        and
                                        local
                                        fluctuation in the speed or the distance between vehicles is all it takes to
                                        trigger
                                        a
                                        system-wide breakdown that persists for hours. In fact, the physicists’ analysis
                                        suggested
                                        such spontaneous breakdowns in traffic flow probably occur quite frequently on
                                        highways.

                                        Though a decidedly unsettling discovery, this showed striking similarities to
                                        the
                                        phenomena
                                        popularized as ‘chaos theory’. This theory has arisen from the understanding
                                        that in
                                        any
                                        complex interacting system which is made of many parts, each part affects the
                                        others.
                                        Consequently, tiny variations in one part of a complex system can grow in huge
                                        but
                                        unpredictable ways. This type of dramatic change from one state to another is
                                        similar to
                                        what happens when a chemical substance changes from a vapor to a liquid. It
                                        often
                                        happens
                                        that water in a cloud remains as a gas even after its temperature and density
                                        have
                                        reached
                                        the point where it could condense into water droplets. However, if the vapor
                                        encounters a
                                        solid surface, even something as small as a speck of dust, condensation can take
                                        place and
                                        the transition from vapor to liquid finally occurs. Helbing and Kerner see
                                        traffic
                                        as a
                                        complex interacting system. They found that a small fluctuation in traffic
                                        density
                                        can act
                                        as the ‘speck of dust’ causing a sudden change from freely moving traffic to
                                        synchronized
                                        traffic, when vehicles in all lanes abruptly slow down and start moving at the
                                        same
                                        speed,
                                        making passing impossible.

                                    scientific community in 16th-century London. She (rightly) argues that it is thanks
                                    to
                                    the imaginative collective efforts of the urban scientists that London became the
                                    melting pot in which a new mathematical and experimental culture crystallized.

                                    and fascinating results. She began her research by asking herself a new question:
                                    not
                                    what caused scientific revolution but what the names science and scientist meant in
                                    16th-century London. Then she collected a vast range of sources, from printed books
                                    to
                                    scientific instruments and notebooks, and recorded, in a relational database,
                                    information on the men and women who produced them.

                                    Harkness leads us through the streets of London, showing us, neighborhood by
                                    neighborhood, where the major forms of natural knowledge found homes. For example,
                                    apothecaries settled in Lime Street, in what is now the City, where they created a
                                    dense
                                    network of shops and gardens. Clockmakers, both native craftsmen and many from
                                    overseas,
                                    clustered in several parishes near St Paul’s Cathedral. The once wealthy merchant,
                                    Clement Draper, even managed to transform the King’s Bench prison in Southwark,
                                    where he
                                    served time as a debtor, into a center of research and discussion. By the end of the
                                    book Harkness has mapped London’s scientific communities with astonishing precision.

                                    Moreover, when Harkness reconstructs these groups, she provides not traditional,
                                    static
                                    accounts of their theories, but dynamic analyses of their practices as these
                                    developed
                                    over time. In many cases, she makes clear, the alchemists of Elizabethan London
                                    already
                                    understood that knowledge of nature had to rest not on authority but on familiarity
                                    through practice.

                                    In one crucial respect, Harkness argues, many of the 16th-century London scientists
                                    differed from the later ones of the 17th century. They saw themselves less as
                                    individuals out to gain fame, than as members of larger textual communities bent on
                                    exchanging and compiling information. The passages in which Harkness analyzes the
                                    16th-century practices of note-taking and communication are among the most novel and
                                    informative in this fine book. She shows that they adopted the textual information
                                    processing methods of humanist scholarship to radically new ends.

                                    In this book, Harkness has charted the local and cosmopolitan worlds of science in
                                    Elizabethan London with a learning, precision and intelligence that compel
                                    admiration.
                                    Moreover, she has crafted a complex and effective new analytical mechanism which may
                                    transform the practices of historians of early modern science.

                                    Of all mankind’s manifold creations, language must take pride of place. Other
                                    inventions
                                    – the wheel, agriculture, sliced bread – may have transformed our material
                                    existence,
                                    but the advent of language is what made us human. Compared to language, all other
                                    inventions pale in significance, since everything we have ever achieved depends on
                                    language and originates from it. Without language, we could never have embarked on
                                    our
                                    ascent to unparalleled power over all other animals, and even over nature itself.

                                <p>
                                    But language is foremost not just because it came first. In its own right it is a
                                    tool
                                    of extraordinary sophistication, yet based on an idea of ingenious simplicity: ‘this
                                    marvellous invention of composing out of twenty-five or thirty sounds that infinite
                                    variety of expressions which, whilst having in themselves no likeness to what is in
                                    our
                                    mind, allow us to disclose to others its whole secret, and to make known to those
                                    who
                                    cannot penetrate it all that we imagine, and all the various stirrings of our soul’.
                                    This was how, in 1660, the renowned French grammarians of the Port-Royal abbey near
                                    Versailles distilled the essence of language, and no one since has celebrated more
                                    eloquently the magnitude of its achievement. Even so, there is just one flaw in all
                                    these hymns of praise, for the homage to language’s unique accomplishment conceals a
                                    simple yet critical incongruity. Language is mankind’s greatest invention – except,
                                    of

                                    fascination with language, and it holds many of its secrets.

                                    The instructions accompanying do-it-yourself products are regularly cited as a
                                    source of
                                    unnecessary expense or frustration. Few companies seem to test their instructions by
                                    having them followed by a first-time user. Often, essential information is omitted,
                                    steps in the construction process are taken for granted, and some degree of special
                                    knowledge is assumed. This is especially worrying in any fields where failure to
                                    follow
                                    correct procedures can be dangerous.

                                    Objections to material in plain English have come mainly from the legal profession.
                                    Lawyers point to the risk of ambiguity inherent in the use of everyday language for
                                    legal or official documents, and draw attention to the need for confidence in legal
                                    formulations, which can come only from using language that has been tested in courts
                                    over the course of centuries. The campaigners point out that there has been no
                                    sudden
                                    increase in litigation as a consequence of the increase in plain English materials.

                                    Similarly, professionals in several different fields have defended their use of
                                    technical and complex language as being the most precise means of expressing
                                    technical
                                    or complex ideas. This is undoubtedly true: scientists, doctors, bankers and others
                                    need
                                    their jargon in order to communicate with each other succinctly and unambiguously.
                                    But
                                    when it comes to addressing the non-specialist consumer, the campaigners argue,
                                    different criteria must apply.
